Problems

1. Capture region in to close?
+ Click select window
+ select appilction/window
+ click align region
+ select image
- Why did this happen?
- The capture region was already zoomed in (Aka you already had selected 'select region' or align region)
2. The images are not tracking?
Do you have plex or iris (both these softwares change brightness and the colors of the screen)? 
You have to turn them off when using Auto Split (Since this software compares images)
