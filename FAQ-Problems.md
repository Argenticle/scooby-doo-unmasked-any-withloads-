# Problems

## 1. Capture region in to close?
###  - Why did this happen?
- The capture region was already zoomed in (Aka you already had selected 'select region' or align region)

------------

### - How to prevent
+ Click select window
+ select appilction/window
+ click align region
+ select image

## 2. The images are not tracking?
### - Do you have plex or iris (both these softwares change brightness and the colors of the screen)? 
- You have to turn them off when using Auto Split (Since this software compares images)
### - Other
+ click select window
+ align region
+ select loading screen (the game must match this screem)

## 3. The align region, zooms into the image to much
+ dolpin must be in 4:3 ratio
